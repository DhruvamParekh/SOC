Timeline and Study Material for

Implementation of Machine Learning Models for

Supply Chains Optimisation

Mentors - Mohit, Samuel, Aryan and Vanshika

Timeline:-

1)Week:0:-Python Basics and starting with ML.

2)Week:1-2:-Machine Learning and Basics of supply chains.

3)Week:2:-

This is a 8 week course. The time commitment for the first three weeks will be 10-15 hrs a week

and when the semester starts it will decrease to 6-7 hrs a week.

Week Wise Material:-

Week 0:-

Do any one of the tutorials for python

❖ Python basics and OOP- [LINK]

(watch till 3:55:00, watch the parts you are not familiar with) or

❖ Python Tutorials (Only 15-20 initial videos would do): [I would recommend not using

Python IDE but rather google colab(tutorial ahead) for running the codes]: [LINK]

❖ Google collab tutorial: [LINK]

❖ Git and Github- [LINK] (first 30 mins)

Week 1 and 2:-

❖ 2 Days - Google ML course (First 4 hours) (Link)

➢ Complete up to Validation Set

❖ 3 Days - Google ML course (Next 6 hours)

➢ Complete up to Embeddings

OR
❖ Andrew Ng’s Courses for Machine Learning and Deep Learning are the best but keeping
time in mind I would say if you can complete them it's good otherwise even after the
project whenever you get the time you guys may go through it [LINK1 LINK2]
